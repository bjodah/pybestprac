Development
===========

"Best practises" is a (very) moving target. The concept also builds
upon the notion of convention. Hence it really needs to be a collective
effort. But since github offers (in my oppinion) unprecedented opportunities
for collaboration there is hope that this document won't go stale.

So head over to the repo and file some issues or make a pull request!
